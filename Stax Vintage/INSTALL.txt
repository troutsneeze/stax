Requirements:

  Allegro <http://www.talula.demon.co.uk/allegro/index.html>

To compile:

  make <platform>
  Where platform is either "linux" or "dos".

To install:

  Copy the binary (stax or stax.exe) and *.dat somewhere.
  If you set the environment variable STAX_DATA, it will look for
  the datafiles there. Otherwise, it will look in the same directory
  as the binary itself.

  For example, in linux, you could:

    cp stax /usr/local/bin
	mkdir -p /usr/local/lib/stax
	cp *.dat /usr/local/lib/stax
	export STAX_DATA="/usr/local/lib/stax"

	You could add the last line to /etc/profile to make it system wide
	or to .bash_profile in your home directory so it's there every time
	you login.

  In DOS:
    mkdir c:\stax
	copy stax.exe c:\stax
	copy *.dat c:\stax

	Or just run it from the build directory.
