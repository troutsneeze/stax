It is fun... I mean it.

See the file INSTALL for installation instructions.

 How to Play
-------------

The object of the games is basically to get rid of the blocks as fast
as possible and not let them rise to the top. To get rid of blocks, get
a horizontal or vertical line of 3 or more of the same type of blocks
in a row. Usually, getting more than 3 in a row will make the other
players blocks rise faster, so go for big combos!

A few keys work the same in every game:

  Escape            Quit        (prompted)
  P                 Pause       (any key except P to unpause)
  Backspace         Screenshot  (named stax????.pcx in current directory)

Below is a description of each game and the controls used to play it.
The controls depend on the input device you're using. For joysticks,
the controls are obvious. If you're using the keyboard, there are two
possibilities:

  "Keys 1"
       Up         W
       Down       A
       Left       S
       Right      D
       Button     Space

  "Keys 2"
       Up         Up Arrow
       Down       Down Arrow
       Left       Left Arrow
       Right      Right Arrow
       Button     Right Control


  Sucka!
  ------
  Suck blocks up with your handy electro-magnet, and drop them into place.
  If your blocks reach the top, you lose.. so don't let them.. or else
  you'll lose!

  Left/Right                Move the magnet
  Up/Button                 Suck a block up
  Down                      Release a block


  Clobber
  -------
  Shoot blocks, popping other blocks that are in your path. You only
  have a limited number of charges though, so use them wisely. At the
  top of the screen, you'll see something like this:
      
      10 [##  ] O
  
  10 is the number of charges you have left. [##  ] is the Charge-o-Meter.
  In this case, it's at two, which means it will bring your charges down
  to 8 and blast through 2 blocks. The O is the next block you'll get.
  You gain charges by getting combos of more than 3 blocks. So if you pop
  5 blocks at once, you'll gain 5-3=2 charges. You'll also gain charges
  gradually over time. If you tap the button without holding it, it will
  still cost you a single charge but won't break through any other blocks.

  Left/Right                Move the blaster
  Button Press (hold)       Charge up the Charge-o-Meter
  Button Release            Release the block

  Shifty
  ------
  Shift entire rows of blocks to the left or right. You have to wait until
  the meter at the top of the screen is full until you can shift the blocks
  again. It is action packed fun that the entire family can enjoy!

  Up/Down                   Move up or down a row
  Left/Right                Shift the blocks to the left or right

  Co-op
  -----
  Player 1 sucks blocks up, and Player 2 drops them. The time is
  displayed at the top, so see how long you can keep the blocks from
  filling up. You can cooperate if you like, or just fight, which is
  a lot more fun.

  Left/Right                Move left or right, respectively
  Button (player 1)         Suck up a block
  Button (player 2)         Drop the block that player 1 sucked up

  Puzzle
  ------
  If you have no friends, this game is for you! All you have to do is
  get rid of all the blocks in a certain number of turns, and see how
  fast you can do it.

  Left/Right/Up/Down        Move the cursor
  Button                    Pop the block under the cursor
  + or =                    Cheat
